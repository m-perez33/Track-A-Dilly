# Track-A-Dilly
Track-A-Dilly is a Full-Stack application crafted to offer a comprehensive overview of project progress with a single glance.
The goal of this intuitive tool is to empower managers to effortlessly monitor project dynamics at a macro level, allowing them to swiftly identify when the team is excelling or when adjustments are needed to catch up. Designed specifically for tracking team projects in professional environments, the front-end is developed using React.js while the backend is built on Node.js.

## Motivation
In my day to day, I have multiple projects running simultaneously. 
Typical questions I would get from management are:

* "How many assets are left to complete?"
* "Are we going to be able to deliver by X date?"
* "Are we behind (do we need to add help to finish on time)?"
* "Are we ahead (can we add some deliverables to this project)?"

Enter Track-A-Dilly! I was looking for a way to easily track these projects visually so management could check in and see the progress easily
Using the dual bar system, it's easy to tell when a project is ahead and when they are falling behind. I've used it for multiple projects and have shared it with my managers

### Features
- Track-A-Dilly provides a simple interface where you can initiate a goal and a due date for your Dilly Project
- Intuitive interface allows for updating Dilly Project goals and due dates as they change.
- Simple progress bar graphics enhance the readability of a Dilly Project's progress
  1. The "Completed" progress bar fills up or empties as you complete projects or update goals.
  2. The "Time Remaining" progress bar fills up or empties, as projects get closer to their due dates or due dates, are adjusted.

For example: If you have 10% time remaining and have completed 90% of your assets then you are right on target!
Any less than 90 and you are running the risk of not finishing on time!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To clone and run locally:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-perez33/Track-A-Dilly.git
  ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
